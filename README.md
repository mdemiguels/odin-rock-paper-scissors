# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors using vanilla JavaScript. This project is created to practice and demonstrate basic JavaScript skills.

This is one of the projects in the initial path of The Odin Project, a free open-source coding curriculum.

## Game Rules

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes. The possible shapes are:

- **Rock**
- **Paper**
- **Scissors**

The game has three possible outcomes other than a tie:

- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Open the browser console (Right-click on the page and select "Inspect", then go to the "Console" tab).
3. Play the game by calling the `playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection)` function in the console, where `playerSelection` is your move (either "rock", "paper", or "scissors") and `computerSelection` is the computer's move.
4. The result of the game will be displayed in the console.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the game.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/odin-rock-paper-scissors.git
