# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors using vanilla JavaScript. This project is created to practice and demonstrate basic JavaScript skills.

This is one of the projects in the initial path of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), a free open-source coding curriculum.

## Game Rules

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes. The possible shapes are:

- **Rock**
- **Paper**
- **Scissors**

The game has three possible outcomes other than a tie:

- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Use the buttons on the page to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. The result of each round and the overall game will be displayed on the page.

## Project Structure
